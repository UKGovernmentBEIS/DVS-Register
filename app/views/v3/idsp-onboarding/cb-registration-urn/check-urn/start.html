    <p>
      Before you start the certification process you need to confirm if the
      digital identity provider that you will be working with has passed the
      pre-screening.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they have passed the pre-sceening, they have been issued a unique
      reference number (URN) that they have shared with you trough email.
    </p>
    <p>
      This form allows you to check if the unique reference number exists and is
      associated with digital identity provider that shared this number with
      you.
    </p>
    <p>To complete the check you will need</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Verify if a provider is trust-marked</li>
      <li>Digital identity providers registered name</li>
      <li>Unique reference number that they provided</li>
    </ul>
